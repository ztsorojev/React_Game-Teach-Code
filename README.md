## The Game
The game is a castle conquest. You have to build an army to defeat a dragon and destroy the castle. <br>
The game is diveded in 4 actions. For each action, we provided an initial code that you have to complete. <br><br>

In Action 1, you received an encrypted message from a spy. <br>

Once you decrypt it, click on Run. If your code is correct, you can move to the next step. <br>
